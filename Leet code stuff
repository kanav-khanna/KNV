This is a tier-based representation of tech companies in India. In most cases, you can realistically move up only one tier at a time. Identify where you currently stand and aim for the next tier above. With some luck (and the right timing), a two-tier jump is possible — especially from Tier 3 to Tier 1. Happy switching!

Tier 1 ┌────────┐ │ FAANG │ --> Meta, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google │ │ (+ Microsoft, Nvidia, OpenAI often included now) └────────┘ │ ↓ Tier 2 ┌──────────────────────────────┐ │ Global Giants in India │ --> Adobe, Salesforce, SAP, IBM, Oracle │ High Pay MNC Dev Centers │ Cisco, VMWare, Qualcomm, etc. Product Cos (Freshworks etc) │ Flipkart, Razorpay, Swiggy, Ola └──────────────────────────────┘ │ ↓ Tier 3 ┌──────────────────────┐ │ Funded Indian Startups│ --> Series A+ startups like Zepto, Dunzo, CRED │ (Some chaos, some gold) └──────────────────────┘ │ Tier 4 ┌───────────────────────────────┐ │ Indian Tech Leaders │ --> Infosys, TCS, Wipro, HCL, LTIMindtree │ companies with 1k + employees. Usually service based. └───────────────────────────────┘ │ ↓ Tier 5 ┌──────────────────────┐ │ Early-stage/No-name │ --> Small bootstrapped startups, founder-led, │ Startups (me, you...)│ often 5-50 people, no brand recall └──────────────────────┘
