What are pointers ?

A type of variable that stores the address of of other variables is a pointer.

How do we see the address of a variable  - & (address of operator)
the meomery address in printed in a hexadecimal format

//Pointer creation 
Int* ptr = address


//Access value stored at the address in the pointer 
Use de refrence operator 
cout<< *ptr //this should print the value if what the pointer points to 


//*ptr = *ptr +1
*ptr is the value present at the address stored in ptr 
so in the code above i am adding + 1 to the location storued at the value  

Arr
&arr   ---all 3 of these will print the same thing which is the base address of the array 
&arr[0] 


*(i+arr) is the same as i[arr]


//Refer to the codes its just better like that lol
